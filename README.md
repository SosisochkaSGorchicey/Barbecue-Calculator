# Barbecue Calculatot
## This is an android mobile app called "Barbecue Calculator" that was made for training purposes.
### Language: Kotlin

Basically it is a calculator that counts an ideal amount of meat beasd on:
- meat type
- amount of people
- time that they consider they will spend hanging out
- overall hunger

This application can most likely be improved, but it works and this is already a great success for me!:nerd_face:
